# Calculating-the-Orbit-of-a-Celestial-Object-using-the-Euler-Method
This Python code calculates the orbits of celestial objects (such as planets or moons) around a central object (such as a planet or a star) using the Euler method. The orbits are calculated based on the masses of the objects and their initial positions and velocities.
